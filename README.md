# Vapula v1.0

Videogame created for personal learning processes and overall enjoyment.

This game was developed with:
- [Unreal Engine 4.13.2](https://www.unrealengine.com/) developed by [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/)
- [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/) Photoshop CS 6 *Trial Version*
- [Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/) Maya

The games theme was inspired by recent indie games and developers. More specifically games from the rouge-like genre for instance _The Binding of Isaac_, _Enter the Gungeon_, _Risk of Rain_, etc...

The whole objective of this project is to create a fun multiplayer third person game which has randomly generated maps.
